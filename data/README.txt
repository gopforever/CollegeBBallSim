data/teams.csv format
---------------------
Columns: School,Nickname,Conference,Rating

• School: Official school name (e.g., "Duke")
• Nickname: Team nickname/mascot (e.g., "Blue Devils")
• Conference: Any string (e.g., "ACC")
• Rating: 30–95 recommended. 75 = good tournament team.

You can replace teams.csv with a FULL Division I list (300+ teams). The app will adapt:
- Schedules: single/double round robin within each conference + non-conf games (configurable).
- Conference tournaments: single-elimination, neutral site.
- National bracket: automatically sized to 8/16/32/64 based on total team count.

Tip: Start with a smaller subset while testing, then expand.
